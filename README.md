# Red-wine-quality
• Collected a red wine quality dataset from the web and performed comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure consistency and accuracy.

• Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between wine quality and various chemical parameters (e.g., alcohol, acidity, pH).

• Visualized key features and their correlation with wine quality to uncover patterns using seaborn and matplotlib.

• Applied label binarization to prepare the data for classification.

• Built a Random Forest Classifier model that achieved an accuracy of 93% in predicting the quality of wine based on chemical properties.

• Developed a predictive system to assess wine quality based on input features.
